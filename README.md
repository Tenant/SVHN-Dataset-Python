# SVHN-Dataset-Python
This Repository Demonstrates my attempts at creating a small model which can recognize digits and later on can be integrated into an app.

Requirements-

1)A Powerfull Machine(My machine has an core i7 processor with 2GB Graphics card and 8GB RAM.This Code crashes in my system.)
2)Python 3.x
3)Tensorflow
4)Scipy,Numpy

This Repository will contain 2 Files.The First file will be used to preprocessed the data while the second file will be used to run the CNN Model(2D CNN).

CNN Structure

1)CNN
2)Max Pool Layer
3)CNN
4)Max Pool Layer
5)CNN
5)Max Pool Lyaer
6)Fully Connected Layer
7)Matrix Multiplication

This is my First ever Github Repository so it might not be very well documented.Apologies for that.

A lot of thanks to this excellent repository https://github.com/prafsoni/SVHN which acted like a guide while developing this Model.
I have chosen very small weights and biases as my machine does not support weights which are very high numerically.All the files should be placed in the project directory.

If anyone can execute my code and let me know how it runs i'd be oblidged if anyone can do this.

Let's get started!!!
